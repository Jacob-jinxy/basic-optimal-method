# basic-optimal-method
* the project is intended to collect basic convex optimal methods and their extensions. 
* they are raw and of course not for commercial use. most of them haven't been packed yet.
* for me, the project is for reviewing those algorithms, and i hope it may help you in some ways.
* every class shall be updated within a week
